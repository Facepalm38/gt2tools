# gt2tools

All of the Gran Turismo related tooling and research code written by pez2k, sometimes based on code or research by adeyblue, Leo2236, Xenn, Submaniac, and others.

Not all projects do something useful, and not all code is clean and readable, depending on how quickly it was put together. Some projects have also been superceded by rewritten or more functional equivalents. Please see the releases for pre-built binaries of any useful tooling.

If using any of this code or research for other projects, please let me (pez2k) know, as I'd be interested to see what it's useful for.
